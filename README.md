## Developer Setup

To make your own build, make sure you have the latest versions of Node.js (4+) and NPM (3+) installed. Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

    npm install
    npm install -g gulp
    
Once you make changes to the files in the `src` directory, build the site by running

    gulp
    
The built/compiled/minified site will be available in the `dist` directory.
